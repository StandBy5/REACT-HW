Generating random text
======================

Say you want to generate random text in Korean.
How would you do it?

The easiest way would probably be to have your cat walk across your keyboard
which would result in something like this [#]_::

    ㅕ키ㅔ츄ㅑㅋ응아 ㅝㄴㅇ 쿄ㅛㅍㄹㅎ튜허ㅓㅎㅠㅅㄴ마

However a sequence of random letters like this does not make any sense.
Normally, Korean text is formed with a sequence of words, formed by a sequence of syllables, which are each formed with two to three types of the keyboard, each uniquely called choseong, jungseong, jongseong [#]_.
(though in casual chatting, just one type of the keyboard is common as well, ex: "ㅋㅋㅋ")
So now we educate our cat to type syllables::

    로켘불됴약 니앙굷 췡바이꿻노기

Then we notice that in Korean, the syllable '이' is more frequently used than '앙' and definitely much more than '꿻' or '굷'.
If our cat knew that, he would have typed something like this::

    다이는가 고다하에지 요그이데습

But then, this still doesn't make any sense because the syllables do
